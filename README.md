# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Setup Instructions

## GitHub Actions Setup Instructions for KHarish15/testing5

This project, containing a single HTML file, doesn't require a build process, testing framework, or external dependencies.  Therefore, GitHub Actions will be used for simple tasks like deployment or validation of the HTML, rather than comprehensive testing.

**1. Adding the Workflow File**

Create a file named `.github/workflows/html-validation.yml` in your repository.  This workflow will check for structural validity of the HTML.

```yaml
name: HTML Validation

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Or the branch you want to trigger on

jobs:
  validate-html:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16
      - name: Validate HTML
        run: |
          html-validate index.html  # Replace index.html if your file is named differently.
          
          
```

**2. Required Environment Variables**

None needed for this project.

**3. Dependencies to Install**

No external packages or dependencies required.

**4. How to Configure the Test Framework**

N/A.  There is no test framework.

**5. How to View Test Results**

There are no test results in the traditional sense. The `html-validate` command will output any errors or warnings directly to the GitHub Actions console. Look for any warnings or errors on the GitHub Actions run page.  If the HTML is valid, the console will be clear.

**6. Troubleshooting Common Issues**

* **`html-validate` not found:** You need to install the `html-validate` command-line utility.  On Ubuntu-latest, this is easily handled by adding the following `run:` command to the workflow:

```yaml
      - name: Install html-validate
        run: npm install -g html-validate
```

* **Error during validation:** Check the error message in the GitHub Actions output.  Common issues are incorrect HTML tags, missing closing tags, and incorrect attributes.

* **No workflow run:**  Ensure the `.github/workflows/html-validation.yml` file is committed to your repository.  Verify that the `push` event is correctly triggered based on your `on` configuration (check the branch you are pushing to or your specific push events if needed).


**7. Project-Specific Configuration Steps**

* **File Naming:** Change `index.html` in the `run:` command to the actual name of your HTML file if it's different.
* **Advanced Validation (Optional):** If more comprehensive HTML validation is needed, consider using other tools like `htmllint`, which offer a broader range of checks (using `npm install -g htmllint`). The `html-validate` command is more basic, but perfectly sufficient for simple validation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **HTML5 Validator:**  Consider using a dedicated HTML5 validator service online (e.g., W3C validator) for local validation.  This provides more comprehensive feedback than a simple command-line tool.


By following these steps, your HTML file will be validated automatically whenever a push is made to the designated branch. This ensures that the HTML structure is consistent and follows standard HTML syntax, helping prevent potential issues in later stages of your project, even if you don't have a full testing suite.
